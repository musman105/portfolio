            <p>1.	People’s Choice Bank Transformation Project – Datacenter Engineer
                1.1.	Replacing a Faulty Hard Drive on HPE Server (ESXi Host)
                
                While managing a production ESXi environment on an HPE ProLiant DL380 server, I received a RAID degradation alert via HPE iLO, indicating a failed hard disk in one of the RAID-5 arrays. This server hosted several business-critical virtual machines, so maintaining uptime and data integrity was essential.
                
                My responsibility was to replace the failed hard drive with minimal impact on services, ensure the RAID array rebuilt successfully, and return the ESXi host to full operational status.
                
                I first logged into the vSphere Client and placed the ESXi host into maintenance mode after migrating active VMs to other hosts using vMotion. I confirmed the failed drive through HPE iLO’s storage section, which showed a solid amber light on the physical bay and flagged the degraded array.
                Next, I accessed the HPE Smart Storage Administrator (SSA) via Intelligent Provisioning to review the RAID configuration and verify the failed disk's slot. I documented the array settings and proceeded to hot-swap the failed drive with a compatible HPE spare.
                After insertion, the Smart Array controller automatically detected the new disk and initiated a RAID rebuild. I monitored the rebuild progress through iLO and SSA to ensure there were no anomalies. Once the rebuild completed successfully, I verified the storage status within ESXi and exited maintenance mode.
                
                The entire operation was completed without any service disruption. The RAID array was fully rebuilt, and the ESXi host returned to normal operation. This proactive resolution avoided potential data loss and reinforced system reliability, and I later implemented automated email alerts via iLO for faster future responses.
                
                1.2.	Resolving a Missing CIFS Share on HPE Data Protector
                
                During my shift, an automated backup job on HPE Data Protector failed unexpectedly. On investigation, I discovered that a mapped CIFS share used as a backup target was missing from the filesystem, which impacted several scheduled file system backup jobs across multiple Windows clients.
                
                My task was to identify the root cause of the missing CIFS share, restore connectivity, and ensure backups resumed successfully — all within our recovery time objective (RTO).
                
                I began by reviewing the Data Protector job logs, which indicated a "No device found" or "Mount point not available" error. I verified the backup server and noticed that the CIFS share mount was not visible under the expected mount path.
                Using mount and df -h on the Linux-based HPE DP server, I confirmed the CIFS share was not mounted. I attempted to manually remount it using:
                mount -t cifs //fileserver/backup /mnt/backup -o username=backupuser,password=*****
                The mount failed, so I checked network connectivity to the file server and confirmed that DNS resolution and SMB port access were working. Next, I checked the file server itself and found that the share was temporarily disabled due to a permissions misconfiguration during a recent file server patch.
                I coordinated with the Windows team to re-enable and re-permission the share, then successfully re-mounted the CIFS share on the HPE DP server. Once mounted, I restarted the failed backup sessions manually and monitored them to successful completion.
                
                The CIFS share was restored within the hour, and all backup jobs resumed without requiring a full rerun or rollback. I documented the incident, added a pre-job mount check script to future backup workflows, and worked with the storage team to implement CIFS mount alerts. This incident reinforced my proactive approach to troubleshooting and helped improve system resilience.

                Automation	Use Maintenance Windows and ADR (Automatic Deployment Rules) for recurring tasks
                
                1.4.	🏦 People’s Choice Bank – Cloud Migration & Data Centre Operations
                
                People’s Choice Bank had engaged a Managed Service Provider (MSP) to deliver a cloud migration and transformation project. At the time, the project was in transition, requiring both hands-on technical support and cross-functional coordination to move it into a stable, operational state.
                
                As a Data Centre Engineer, I was tasked with supporting the infrastructure aspect of the migration. In addition, I took on extended responsibilities to help transition the cloud migration initiative into the Business-as-Usual (BAU) phase, and I was also responsible for planning the bank’s annual data centre shutdown in coordination with vendors and stakeholders.
                
                I collaborated closely with the Service Delivery Manager and internal/external teams, actively learning and performing activities across various technical towers including cloud, network, storage, and backup. I facilitated knowledge transfer sessions, bridged communication gaps between teams, and ensured operational readiness as the project moved toward BAU. For the data centre shutdown, I led the planning and execution, created runbooks, coordinated vendor schedules, and ensured minimal disruption during the activity.
                
                The cloud migration project was successfully stabilised and transitioned to BAU, improving service delivery and operational ownership. The data centre shutdown was completed without incident, meeting timelines and compliance standards, and reinforcing confidence in our infrastructure readiness and vendor coordination.
                
                2.	 (Allied Banking – Data Centre Operations / DR Planning and Implementation)
                
                2.1.	Annual Disaster Recovery Exercise – Full DC Switchover
                As part of an annual DR exercise for a leading bank, we were tasked with simulating a complete failure of the Primary Data Centre (DC1) and successfully switching all banking applications — both critical and non-critical — to the Alternate DR Data Centre (DC2). Key applications included Core Banking, ATM Switch, and Internet Banking, all with a mandated 4-hour RTO.
                A technical challenge was that the Core Banking application stack (web/app/database) was hosted in DC1 with different IP addressing at the DR site, requiring a non-standard switchover strategy. In contrast, all other applications were hosted on VMware, using the same IP scheme across both DCs, facilitated by OTV (Overlay Transport Virtualization) on Nexus 7K to extend Layer 2.
                ________________________________________
                Ensure seamless recovery of the entire banking platform by:
                •	Executing an IP-differentiated switchover of the Core Banking system
                •	Achieving seamless failover of VMware-hosted applications via OTV
                •	Maintaining RTO ≤ 4 hours for critical systems and ensuring full system functionality at DC2.
                ________________________________________
                🔴 Core Banking Switchover (Different IP Address Strategy)
                To switch Core Banking to DR with a different network/IP addressing schema, we followed a staged approach:
                1.	Stop incoming traffic:
                o	Blocked inbound traffic at perimeter firewalls and upstream load balancers.
                o	Informed integration partners (payment gateways, host interfaces) to hold connections.
                2.	Shutdown at Primary DC (DC1):
                o	Gracefully shut down Web Servers, followed by Application Servers.
                o	Triggered a controlled database switchover to promote the DR replica (Oracle Data Guard) as Primary.
                3.	Energize at DR (DC2):
                o	Brought up Application Servers and connected them to the newly promoted Primary DB.
                o	Brought up Web Servers and verified app functionality via internal testing.
                4.	Reopen Network Traffic:
                o	Reconfigured external DNS entries where required.
                o	Enabled firewall and load balancer policies to allow traffic into the DR web front end.
                This strategy ensured a clean and verifiable cutover, despite differing IP architectures, and avoided overlapping route conflicts.
                ________________________________________
                🟡 VMware-Based Applications Switchover (Same IP via OTV)
                •	All non-core applications, including Internet Banking, ATM Switch, Treasury, HRMS, and Reporting, resided on a VMware virtualized infrastructure.
                •	We utilized OTV on Cisco Nexus 7K to extend Layer 2 between DC1 and DC2, allowing us to:
                o	Retain same IP and VLANs at both sites.
                o	Seamlessly vMotion and start up virtual machines at DC2 without IP reconfiguration.
                •	VM replication was handled via vSphere Replication and SRM (Site Recovery Manager).
                •	Services were brought online in defined tiers:
                o	Tier 1 (Critical): ATM Switch, Internet Banking – started first and validated for user transactions.
                o	Tier 2 (Non-Critical): Treasury, HRMS, Compliance apps – brought up post Tier 1 validation.
                ________________________________________
                •	All critical applications, including Core Banking, were restored within the 4-hour RTO window.
                •	The Core Banking switchover using a shut–switch–start approach with IP realignment was executed successfully without customer impact.
                •	All VMware-based apps came up smoothly at the DR site using same IPs, thanks to OTV Layer 2 extension.
                •	Full user journey and transaction validations were completed by application owners and business testers.
                •	The test outcome was documented and signed off, with lessons learned used to refine DR runbooks and fallback procedures.
